#This project is a practice for me and my target is to blend what I learned in Calculus to make a
#calculator that can find e^x w an error under 10^-8.


#Begin
#Creating the variables
x = int(input("Enter a degree x for calculating e^x: "))
n = 0
solving = int(1)
term = float(0)

#Creating a function which calculates answer
def calculator(x, n, solving, term):
    term = float(0)
    #Creating a function which calculates the factorial
    def factorial(n):
        solving = 1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            solving = solving * i
        return solving
    while n < 30:   #This chunk of code should find the series for n terms.
        term = float(x**n/factorial(n) + term)
        n += 1
        print(term)

#Printing
calculator(x, n, solving, term)
